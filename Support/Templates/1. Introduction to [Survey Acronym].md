# Introduction to [Full Name of Survey] ([Survey Acronym)]

## What is the [CCC] [survey Acronym]?

Short introduction to what the survey is, meaning a paragraph of a few lines. Example:

The Indian Employment and Unemployment Survey (EUS) is the Indian Labour Force Survey run as part to India’s National Sample Survey series from 1987 to 2011.

## What does the [CCC] [survey Acronym] cover?

Short paragraph on the topics covered as well as information on the years and the sample sizes. Example:

The Indian EUS is a labour force survey collecting information on demographic details (age, sex, location), education (both academic and vocational), labour market activities over the past 12 months, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. Some years contain further information on consumption expenditure. The years and sample size of EUS harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 1987	| 129,060		| 667,804		|
| …	| …			| …			|
| 2011	| 101,724		| 456,999		|

## Where can the data be found

Paragraph on the source of the data and the documentation. If publicly available for download refer to this explicitly. If the data can only be circulated within the World Bank, make a note of this. If the data, can only be used after filling out a special data request form explain so. Say to get in touch with Jobs Group (cannot provide an email address for now, need to create one) – only WB staff should get in touch, though. Example:

The microdata are free and publicly available on the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s (MOSPI) [National Data Archive of microdata]( http://microdata.gov.in/nada43/index.php/catalog/EUE). The website also provides all necessary documentation.

## What is the sampling procedure

A paragraph with an overview of the procedure. It is OK to paste an introductory paragraph from the documentation with reference. If the procedure varies over time make a brief note of it. Example:

The EUS uses a stratified multi-stage design. The [2009 manual]( http://microdata.gov.in/nada43/index.php/catalog/124/download/1274) states the outline of the sampling procedure as:

    A stratified multi-stage design has been adopted for the 66th
    round survey. The first stage units (FSU) will be the 2001 census villages (Panchayat wards in case of Kerala) in the rural sector and Urban Frame Survey (UFS) blocks in the urban sector. The ultimate stage units (USU) will be households in both the sectors. In case of large FSUs, one intermediate stage of sampling will be the selection of two hamlet-groups (hgs)/ sub-blocks (sbs) from each rural/ urban FSU.Note changes over time.
