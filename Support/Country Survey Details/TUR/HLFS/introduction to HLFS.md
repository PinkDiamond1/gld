# Introduction to the Turkish Household and Labour Force Survey (HLFS)

## What is the HLFS?

As explained by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) in their website, the Turkish HLFS is implemented regularly since 1988  and it is the main data source which provides information about those employed; economic activity, occupation, employment status and working hours, and unemployment in Turkey. 

## What does the HLFS cover?

The Turkish HLFS is a labour force survey with information on demographic details (age, gender, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the last 7 days, as well as hours worked and activities over the previous 7 days. The harmonized years and sample size of the GLD are:

## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not available to the public, the researcher/analyst has to purchase access through the [TURKSTAT website](https://www.tuik.gov.tr/Kurumsal/Mikro_Veri). The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Turkish HLFS uses a stratified multi-stage design. According to [TURKSTAT documentation](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Labour-Force-Statistics-2020-37484&dil=2): 

    "Method of Sampling: For Household Labour Force Survey, two-stage stratified cluster sampling method was used. Based on adress, a rotation pattern is formed to ensure a 50% of overlap between two consecutive periods and in the same periods of the two consecutive years and 8 sub samples have been used at each period. In design of the study,  sample size has been equally distributed to the weeks,  which will be applied in each term. In determining sample volume size Eurostat regulation numbered 577/98 is based on. In design of the study, administrative division of the year 2014 is based on. The estimate size of the study is periodically the whole Turkey, annualy is the NUTS Level 2.  
    
    Weighing: Weighting is a method used to obtain parameters from the data set resulting from sampling so as to represent the universe. In the study,  while reaching the final weight, the design weights have been calculated depending on the selection criteria; have been controlled for external distribution and corrected for non-responses. In weightning, age group, gender, NUTS Level 2, urban-rural and household size are based on as external control."

Note: There are changes in the sampling methodology, yet information is only available from 2011 onwards.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detail results by gender, sector (urban or rural), and province. According to [TURKSTAT](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Labour-Force-Statistics-2020-37484&dil=2):
    "Coverage of persons: All private households who are living in the territory of Republic of Turkey are covered. Residents of schools, dormitories, kindergartens, rest homes for elderly persons, special hospitals, military barracks and recreation quarters for officers are not covered."
