## What is the TUR HLFS?

The Turkish HLFS is implemented regularly since 1988  and it provides information about employment, economic activity, occupation, employment status, working hours, and unemployment in Turkey.

The Turkish HLFS is a labour force survey with information on demographic details (age, gender, location), education (academic), migration, labour market activities over the last 7 days, as well as hours worked and activities over the previous 7 days. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are:

## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not available to the public, the researcher/analyst has to purchase access through the [TURKSTAT website](https://www.tuik.gov.tr/Kurumsal/Mikro_Veri). The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to [gld@worldbank.org](gld@worldbank.org).

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Turkish HLFS uses a stratified multi-stage design. The sampling procedure has changed across different survey rounds betweenn 2000-2019. For instance According to the 2019 [TURKSTAT documentation](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Labour-Force-Statistics-2019-33784)

    "Method of Sampling: For Household Labour Force Survey, two-stage stratified cluster sampling method was used. 
    Based on adress, a rotation pattern is formed to ensure a 50% of overlap between two consecutive periods 
    and in the same periods of the two consecutive years and 8 sub samples have been used at each period. 
    In design of the study,  sample size has been equally distributed to the weeks,  which will be applied in each term. 
    In determining sample volume size Eurostat regulation numbered 577/98 is based on. In design of the study, 
    administrative division of the year 2014 is based on. The estimate size of the study is periodically the whole Turkey, 
    annualy is the NUTS Level 2." - Labor Force Newsletter 2019- Accounting Conventions

Note: There are changes in the sampling methodology, yet information is only available from 2011 onwards. The presse releases are the best source of documentation of the sampling and weighting processess for each year. These can be accessed through the following [link](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Kategori/GetKategori?p=istihdam-issizlik-ve-ucret-108&dil=2)

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detail results by gender, sector (urban or rural), and province. According to [TURKSTAT](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Labour-Force-Statistics-2020-37484&dil=2):
             
      "Coverage of persons: All private households who are living in the territory of Republic of Turkey are covered. 
       Residents of schools, dormitories, kindergartens, rest homes for elderly persons, special hospitals, 
        military barracks and recreation  quarters for officers are not covered."


## Other noteworthy aspects

### Household ID

The raw datasets come with ID information masked due to privacy reasons. In the GLD project we have created IDs to provide the best user experience. The IDs had been used to check expanded population numbers, household idâ€™s and the number of  observations, the results resemble those reported by the TURKSTAT.

### Geographic information

TURKSTAT developed the 2000-2013 surveys with a variable for urban, rural categories. However, the 2014-2019 survey do not have a variable for urbanization categories. Further information about this change can be accessed in the press releases from 2014-onwards.
