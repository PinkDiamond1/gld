# Correspondence between the Turkish HLFS occupation codes and ISCO

This document first describes the logic of the process and then provides users with the underlying conversions tables as well as the  the harmonization codes.

## Occupation codes used in the Turkishâ€™s HLFS

The Turkish *Labour Force Survey* uses the ISCO system to classify occupation answers of the HLFS. There were three different classification systems between 2000 and 2019. 

In the year 2000, the survey used the first digit of the [ISCO-68](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco68/major.htm) classification as per the ILO categories:
> 1. Scientific, technical, professional and related workers
> 2. Administrative, executive and managerial workers
> 3. Clerial and related workers
> 4. Sales workers
> 5. Service workers
> 6. Agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry workers, fisherman and hunters
> 7. Non-agricultural production and related workers, transport, equipment operators and labourers
> 8. Workers not classifiable by occupation


Between the years 2001-2011 the survey uses the first digit of the [ISCO-88](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco88/major.htm) classification again following the ILO categories. 

> 1. Legislators, senior officials and managers
> 2. Professionals
> 3. Technicians and market sales workers
> 4. Clerks
> 5. Service workers and shop and market sales workers
> 6. Skilled agricultural and fishery workers
> 7. Craft and related trade workers
> 8. Plant and machine operators and assemblers
> 9. Elementary occupations

Finally between the years 2012-2019 the survey used the first digit of the [ISCO-08](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm).

In the Harmonized GLD, skill level variables were developed for only ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 variables because the information of correspondance with ISCO-68 is not available in the ILO website.
