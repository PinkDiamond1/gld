Introduction to the Mexican Labour Force Survey (ENOE)
================

### The ENOE

ENOE or "Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo" is a national
survey that record labor information from the Mexican people. The
Survey is conducted quarterly with two different questionnaires 
i.e., extended and shorter versions. 

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

In the past fifteen years, the Mexican national statistics institute
(INEGI) published five versions of the labor force questionnaire or
ENOE. The ENOE has two versions: the extended version and the shorter
version. Every quarter, the INEGI conducts labor surveys using either
version.

Over time ENOE was revised by the INEGI. the INEGI introduced five revisions of
the extended version and two for the shorter version of the questionnaire.

### Information used in the GLD harmonization

As part of the harmonization process the team chose b


In addition, INEGI periodically updates each questionnaire version. The
fact that there is no unique questionnaire for the entire year
introduces seasonality in the input, which could impact the process of
data analysis for the user.












## Absent Topics

After analyzing the questionnaire versions, the team concluded that
using quarter one data reduces seasonality because INEGI collected
quarter one data across the years using the extended version. The only
exception is quarter one data for years 2007 and 2008.

In table 1. the team summarized the list of absent topics in the
extended and the short questionnaire versions.
