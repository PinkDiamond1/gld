Introduction to the Mexican Labour Force Survey (ENOE)
================

### The ENOE

ENOE or "Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo" is a national
survey that record labor information from the Mexican people. The
Survey is conducted quarterly with two different questionnaires 
i.e., extended and basic versions. 

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

In the past fifteen years, the Mexican national statistics institute
(INEGI) published five versions of the labor force questionnaire or
ENOE. The ENOE has two versions: the extended version and the basic
version. Every quarter, the INEGI conducts labor surveys using either
version.

Over time ENOE was revised by the INEGI. the INEGI introduced five revisions of
the extended version and two for the basic version of the questionnaire.

### Information used in the GLD harmonization

Since ENOE reports quarterly results using different questionnaires, the 
harmonization team choose between annualizing quarterly results or choosing 
one quarter with mostly similar questionnaire questions. The fact that there 
is no unique questionnaire for the entire year introduces seasonality in 
the input, which could impact the process of data analysis for the user.

Annualizing data means that the results from extended and basic version 
questionnaires would merge which may cause lose of information. In table 2. 
the team summarized the list of absent topics in the extended and 
the basic questionnaire versions.

| Extended Version                                                                               | Basic Version                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Questions about situation after losing a job and the length of unemployment or job inactivity. | Questions about migration and additional labor opportunities (second job).                                                       |
|                                                                                                | Questions on financial, social and economic support such as syndicate enrollment, public social welfare benefits, and insurance. |

After analyzing the questionnaire versions, the team concluded that using 
quarterly questionnaires data reduces seasonality because INEGI collected quarter one 
data across the years using the extended version. The only exception 
is quarter one data for years 2007 and 2008.
