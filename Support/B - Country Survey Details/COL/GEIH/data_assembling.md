 # For users of the DANE public microdata 
 
The user should follow the recommendations below to assembly the microdata used with the do files on this page, 

1- The microdata for the GEIH is available by month in the .stata, .txt, .sav and .csv formats on a monthly frequency. It is possible that some years (2017).  The data for some months is available in one format, while the rest of the months only have another reading format. 

2- For the WBG users, the harmonization team prepared to do files that pre-process the monthly data into one file, please check the C://programs location in your GLD server access domain for the respective years.

3- Each year has monhtly migration data that is merged to the main data with another code available in the GLD "programs" folder.

4- the identifiers shall never contain months to preserve the sample size. In the do-files from 2009, 2011 and 2020, the harmonization team has included a long process of sorting month information against id values to recognize duplicates.  

5- The data for  "Amazonia & orinoquía" and the City of "San Andrés" had been included separately from the rest. Yet, the codes to merge monthly to annual data followed for all years has been the same as with the main GEIH files. File locations for the unified files are available in the harmonized do-files.

6- Do not skip the merging of San Andrés and Amazonía & Orinoquía data because otherwise, the values of urbanization and labour participation will be inaccurate. 

Please note that the GLD programs folder is only available for authorized users within the world bank. for further questions and requests kindly contact gld@worldbank.org .
