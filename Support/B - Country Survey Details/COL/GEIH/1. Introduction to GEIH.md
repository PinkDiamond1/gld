## What is the COL GEIH?

The Extended unified Colombian household survey (GEIH) is the colombian national household survey that records information from the labour force, income and household spending since 2006 (in the current format). 

## What does the COL GEIH cover?

The Colombia GEIH is a household survey collecting information on age, sex, location, migration, education (academic), living conditions,income, labour market activities over 12 months, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days.  The years and sample size of GEIH harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Individuals 	| # of Households	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 2009	| 	815,480	| 	220,989	|
| 2010	| 	821,951	| 	226,261	|
| 2011	| 	827,522	| 	230,499	|
| 2012	| 	684,060 | 	209,920 |
| 2013	| 	772,074	| 	228,944	|

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata are free and publicly available on the Colombian National Data Archive (ANDA) [online access](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/MICRODATOS/about_collection/23/?per_page=5). The website also provides all necessary documentation for each year, including format of the survey in spss, stata (from september 2017- onwards), cvs and txt.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The GEIH uses a probabilistic, multistage design, stratified, unequal clustered, and self-weighted. 

The 2009 manual (see document *Metodología Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares* under the ["Related Materials" section of the 2009 documentation site](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/207/related_materials)) outlines the sampling procedure as:

    Taking into account the objectives of the GEIH Survey, and the fundamental premises, a probabilistic, multi-stage, stratified, unequal conglomerate and self-weighted design was chosen (for the twenty-four capital cities with their metropolitan areas).

Note that, even though the sampling logic is consitent over time, there could be changes over time (please consult documentation for each year).

## What is the geographic significance level?

The data covers national information at the urban and rural levels. It also includes information on the lartgest regions and political geographic representations (departments). Overall, the sample covers five regions: Atlantic, Oriental, Central, Pacific and Bogota and twenty-four cities and metropolitan areas.
