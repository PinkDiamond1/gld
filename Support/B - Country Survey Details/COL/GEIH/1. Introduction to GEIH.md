## What is the COL GEIH?

The Extended unified Colombian household survey (GEIH) is the national household survey that records information from the labour force, income and household spending since 2006 (in the current format). Earlier, the EHN (the 1970s) used to record the national household information. 

## What does the COL GEIH cover?

The Colombia GEIH is a household survey collecting information on age, sex, location, migration, education (academic), living conditions,income, labour market activities over 12 months, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days.  The years and sample size of GEIH harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Individuals 	| # of Households	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 2009	| 	815,480	| 	220,989	|
| 2010	| 	821,951	| 	226,261	|
| 2011	| 	827,522	| 	230,499	|
| 2012	| 	684,060 | 	209,920 |
| 2013	| 	772,074	| 	228,944	|
| 2014	| 	788,101	|   228,932 |
| 2015	| 	707,597	| 	209,350	|
| 2016	| 	701,013	|   288,763 |
| 2017	| 	691,278	|   208,521 |
| 2018	| 	762,753	|   231,128	|
| 2019	| 	756,063 | 	231,831	|
| 2020	| 	747,822	| 	229,935	|
| 2021	| 	711,381 | 	225,853	|

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata are free and publicly available on the Colombian National Data Archive (ANDA) [National Data Archive of microdata](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/MICRODATOS/about_collection/23/?per_page=5). The website also provides all necessary documentation.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The GEIH uses a probabilistic, multistage design, stratified, unequal clustered, and self-weighted. 

The 2009 manual (see document *Metodolog√≠a Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares* under the ["Related Materials" section of the 2009 documentation site](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/207/related_materials)) outlines the sampling procedure as:

    Taking into account the objectives of the GEIH Survey, and the fundamental premises, a probabilistic,                 multi-stage, stratified, unequal conglomerate and self-weighted design was chosen (for the twenty-four capital cities with their metropolitan areas).

Note that, even though the sampling logic is consitent over time, there are changes over time (consult each year methodology).

## What is the geographic significance level?

It cover national information at the urban and rural levels. It also includes information on the lartgest regions and provinces (departments). The sample covers five regions: Atlantic, Oriental, Central, Pacific and Bogota and twenty-four cities and metropolitan areas.
