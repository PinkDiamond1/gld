## What is the COL survey?

The Extended unified Colombian household survey (GEIH) is the colombian national household survey that records information from the labour force, income and household spending since 2006 (in the current format). 

## What does the COL survey cover?

The Colombia GEIH is a household survey collecting information on age, sex, location, migration, education (academic), living conditions,income, labour market activities over 12 months, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days.  The years and sample size of GEIH harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Individuals 	| # of Households	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 2009	| 	815,480	| 	220,989	|
| 2010	| 	821,951	| 	226,261	|
| 2011	| 	827,522	| 	230,499	|
| 2012	| 	684,060 | 	209,920 |
| 2013	| 	772,074	| 	228,944	|
| 2014	| 	788,101	|   228,932 |
| 2015	| 	707,597	| 	209,350	|
| 2016	| 	701,013	|   288,763 |
| 2017	| 	691,278	|   208,521 |
| 2018	| 	762,753	|   231,128	|
| 2019	| 	756,063 | 	231,831	|
| 2020	| 	747,822	| 	229,935	|
| 2021	| 	711,381 | 	225,853	|

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata are free and publicly available on the Colombian National Data Archive (ANDA) [online access](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/MICRODATOS/about_collection/23/?per_page=5). The website also provides all necessary documentation for each year, including format of the survey in spss, stata (from september 2017- onwards), cvs and txt.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The GEIH uses a probabilistic, multistage design, stratified, unequal clustered, and self-weighted. 

The 2009 manual (see document *Metodología Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares* under the ["Related Materials" section of the 2009 documentation site](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/207/related_materials)) outlines the sampling procedure as:

    Taking into account the objectives of the GEIH Survey, and the fundamental premises, a probabilistic, multi-stage, stratified, unequal conglomerate and self-weighted design was chosen (for the twenty-four capital cities with their metropolitan areas).

Note that, even though the sampling logic is consitent over time, there could be changes over time (please consult documentation for each year).

## What is the geographic significance level?

The data covers national information at the urban and rural levels. It also includes information on the lartgest regions and political geographic representations (departments). Overall, the sample covers five regions: Atlantic, Oriental, Central, Pacific and Bogota and twenty-four cities and metropolitan areas.

| 13 large cities	| 11 intermediate Cities	|
| :-------	| :--------		| 
|Bogotá | Tunja
| Medellín - Valle de Aburrá | Florencia
| Cali - Yumbo | Popayán
| Barranquilla - Soledad | Valledupar
| Bucaramanga - Floridablanca - Girón - Piedecuesta | Quibdó
| Manizales - Villamaría | Neiva
| Pasto | Riohacha

## Other noteworthy aspects

### The year 2020

In 2020 the Colombian institute of statistics (DANE) conducted the GEIH through phone surveys. As a result, the data retrieved contains inconsistencies for March through July. In particular,  personal information (such as labour status) was absent from the survey responses for this month. The absence of information happened due to the challenge of surveying during a global pandemic. As such, the user should note these limitations. The harmonization team has done its best to reduce the consequences of the absence of data in those months. The resulting harmonization is robust enough as per our harmonization methodology. Please, refer to the do-file for this year for further information.

### Absence of ISCO variable 

In the first iteration of the GLD harmonized files for Colombia, the isco information is absent for all the years. Until recently (mid-2021), the DANE used the national occupation classification or CNO 1970 to categorize occupations of the labour force. The CNO 1970 classification does not directly correspond to the international occupation classification (ISCO), but it was inspired by the isco 1968. As a result, the harmonization team decided to declare the variable as missing for all the harmonized years.

###  ISIC Classification
the DANE used a version of the international industry classification or ISIC  to classify the economic activities in the household survey (geih). In this [webpage](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/sistema-estadistico-nacional-sen/normas-y-estandares/nomenclaturas-y-clasificaciones/tablas-correlativas), DANE has made avaialble tables of correspondance that can be used to compare the national classificaiton to the international version.
