# Changes in industry and occupation classification

In most years, the Thailand LFS have adopted the ISIC and ISCO to classify the industries and occupations of the respondents. While Thailand has its industrial classification system with different versions over the years, it has maintained to use the ISIC not until 2011 when it began using the Thailand Industrial Classification (TSIC) for 2009. On the other hand, Thailand does not have a country-specific occupational classification system and has always used the ISCO for occupational codes.

The changes in the occupational and industrial classification systems have occurred at the same time. Between 1984 and 2000, Thailand LFS adopted the ISCO 1958 and ISIC version 1. Starting 2001, it adopted the ISCO 1988 and ISIC version 3. And in 2011, it began using the ISCO 2008 and the TSIC 2009. 

Because the ISCO 1958 is outdated and not compatible with the specifications of the occupational variables in the GLD, it is converted to ISCO 1968 in terms of three-digit codes, and then into ISCO 1988. Because of the distinctiveness of the ISCO 1958, the ISCO team has not been able to create a correspondence table between ISCO 1958 and ISCO 1988; hence, we rely on two-stage mapping process, which we admit to be vulnerable to information loss. In the end, we are only able to map the three-digit ISCO 1958 with the three-digit ISCO 1988. 

An issue faced in this process is the presence of a many-to-many correspondence when mapping the ISCO 1968 codes with the ISCO 1988 at the three-digit level. In the example below, the code “0-23” can be mapped to two distinct three-digit ISCO 1988 codes (i.e., “213” and “214”). We select the ISCO 1988 code with the greater number of occurrences, which in this case is “214”. When the number of occurrences is equally split between two codes, the code that is lower in value is chosen. That is, if the frequency counts are split between “315” and “316”, “315” will be selected because 315 < 316. There is no logic to this and merely an arbitrary rule selection.
