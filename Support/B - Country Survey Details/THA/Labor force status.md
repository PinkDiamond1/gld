# Labor force status

The Thailand NSO reports unemployment to include individuals that are either seeking work or available for work. In contrast, the GLD defines the unemployed as those who are seeking and available for work. The **lstatus** variable codes individuals who are (a) seeking but not available for work and (b) not seeking but available for work as not in the labor force, while based on the NSO definition, these groups are included in the unemployed population.

In other words, the THA NSO unemployed is the sum of the GLD unemployed + potential labor force (LF) as a fraction of the sum of the labor force population and the potential labor force population. The line graph below confirms that the Thailand NSO unemployment numbers can be derived based on this formula.
